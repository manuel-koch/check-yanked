# Check if Python packages installed via PyPi are marked as yanked

Run `check-yanked.py` in your Python environment to see if any installed package
is marked as **yanked** on __PyPi__, see [PyPi docs](https://docs.pypi.org/project-management/yanking/).

The tool only uses functionality that is available in a plain Python installation and
should therefore be usable without installing any additional python packages.
