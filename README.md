# Check if Python packages installed via PyPi are marked as yanked

Run `check-yanked.py` in your Python environment to see if any installed package
is marked as **yanked** on __PyPi__.

The tool only uses functionality that is available in a plain Python installation and
should therefore be usable without installing any additional python packages.
